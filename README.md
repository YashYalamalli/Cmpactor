PM Compaction Tonnage Calculator

Streamlit App for Powder Metallurgy â€” Uniaxial Compaction

This interactive app estimates the press tonnage required to achieve a target green density in powder metallurgy (PM) parts using the Heckel equation. It allows you to enter material constants, part geometry, and density, and outputs the required compaction force, tonnage, and visualizations.

Features

Interactive input for:

Material selection (predefined or custom)

Part shape: solid or hollow cylinder

Dimensions: outer and inner diameters

Density input: green density or relative density

Safety factor for practical adjustments

Automatic calculation of:

Relative density

Compaction pressure (MPa)

Force (N)

Tonnage (metric tons)

Interactive plots:
